  - "#### Information"
  - "Each cell in the grid represents an Akshara in the word. The colour in the **left** half of the cell represents the **Vyanjana** and the colour in the **right** half represents the **Svara**."
  - "The colours in the cell represent the following:"
  - "<div style='background-color: green; width: 20px; height: 20px; display: inline-block;'></div> The Letter is in the correct position"
  - "<div style='background-color: orange; width: 20px; height: 20px; display: inline-block;'></div> The Letter is in the word, but in the wrong position"
  - "<div style='background-color: gray; width: 20px; height: 20px; display: inline-block;'></div> The Letter is not in the word"
  - "So, a completely filled green cell means the Akshara is present in the correct position and a completely filled yellow cell means the Akshara is present in another position."
  - "Additionally, there are 2 special cases of completely filled cells:"
  - "<div style='background-color: red; width: 20px; height: 20px; display: inline-block;'></div> The Svara and atleast one Vyanjana are present in the word, but none of them are in the the correct position"
  - "<div style='background-color: darkblue; width: 20px; height: 20px; display: inline-block;'></div> The Svara and atleast one Vyanjana are in the correct position, but the Akshara is incorrect (Vyanjanas are either missing or extra or in the wrong order)"
